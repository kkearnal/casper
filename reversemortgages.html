          <b>Age qualification:</b> Must be 62 years old or older. If one borrower is under 62, 
          it might be possible to get a reverse mortgage, however, the loan officer will need to collect additional 
          information upfront to determine eligibility. <br><br>
          
          <b>Primary lien:</b> A reverse mortgage must be the primary lien 
          on the home. Any existing mortgage must be paid off using the proceeds from the reverse mortgage. 

<br><br><b>Occupancy requirements:</b> The property used as collateral for the reverse mortgage must be the 
           primary residence. Vacation homes and investor properties do not qualify.

<br><br><b>Taxes and Insurance:</b> Borrowers must remain current on real estate taxes, homeowners insurance, and 
            other mandatory obligations, including condominium fees, hoa fees, etc.

<br><br><b>Property Condition:</b> Borrowers are responsible for completing mandatory repairs and maintaining the
          condition of the property.

          <b>Ownership:</b> With a reverse mortgage, the borrower always retains title or ownership of the home. 
          The lender never owns the home even after the last surviving spouse permanently vacates
          the property. The amount of funds that a borrower is eligible for depends on the age of the youngest 
          recipient, home value, and interest rates.

          <b>Home Equity Conversion Mortgage</b><br>
          HECM (pronounced HEKUM) is the commonly used acronym for a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage, a reverse 
          mortgage created by and regulated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A HECM is not 
          a government loan. It is a loan issued by a mortgage lender, but insured by the Federal Housing 
          Administration, which is part of HUD. Each year the borrower is charged an insurance fee. Your loan 
          balance thus increases by the amount of this fee. The insurance purchased by this fee protects the 
          borrower (1) if and when the lender is not able to make a payment; and (2) if the value of the home upon
          selling is not enough to cover the loan balance. In the latter case, the government insurance fund pays 
          off the remaining balance.Currently, HECMs make up most reverse mortgages offered in America. HECMs come
          with rules and regulations that include a requirement that the borrower receive third-party counseling.
          
          <br><br>
          <b>Proprietary Reverse Mortgage</b>
          Proprietary reverse mortgages are privately insured by the mortgage companies that offer them. They are 
          not subject to all the same regulations as HECMs, but as a standard best practice, most companies that 
          offer proprietary reverse mortgages emulate the same consumer protections that are found in the HECM 
          program, including mandatory counseling.  
          Proprietary reverse mortgages are sometimes called “jumbo” reverse mortgages, because they are taken on
          higher-valued homes. The maximum loan limit on a Home Equity Conversion Mortgage is $625,500, so if you 
          own a home worth several million dollars, you may be able to get more funds from a proprietary reverse 
          mortgage. American Advisors Group, based in Orange, CA, and Finance of America Reverse Mortgage, based 
          in Tulsa, OK, are the only companies that currently offer proprietary reverse mortgages.

          <b>Should My Mom and Dad Get a Reverse Mortgage?</b>
          You are referred to as the “Sandwich Generation.”  You’ve got kids in, or heading for, college as well 
          as aging parents.  Wherever you look, all you can see is additional expenses.
          <br><br>
          In the rough economy of the past few years--with home values and retirement savings down, government
          benefit programs threatened and people living longer--many adults are concerned about their parents 
          being able to finance the remainder of their lives, even if they have been diligent about retirement 
          planning. 
          <br><br>
          The vast majority of older Americans have their wealth tied up in their home equity.  If your parents 
          struggle to pay monthly bills or cover healthcare expenses, then tapping into that equity may be the
          best solution.  A reverse mortgages is a financial product that allows them to do just that.
          <br><br>
          Whether or not a reverse mortgage is the right financial option for your parents is a very personal 
          decision and based on many factors.  In most cases, your parents will discuss this option with you 
          before making their decision.  You want to be prepared to give them the best advice.
