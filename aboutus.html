          I feel like a vocational world traveler when it comes to looking at my background. I grew up on  a dairy farm arising at 4am daily to do the necessary chores and enjoyed a large family experience. As a young man I was a custodian, an onion dehydrator worker, a long-haul furniture mover and a tire/maintenance worker for large trucks. I was reared by strict but loving parents who held each of us accountable for our work and our ethics.Upon getting my degree in Business Management I first worked for Shell Oil Company and then owned my own Shell station for seven years and was voted dealer of the year in the State of California. After receiving my masters in divinity. I was a minister/counsellor for over a decade and then returned to the business world and have been a mortgage banker the last 25 years.

My belief system insures that I try to live by the Golden Rule of "doing unto others as you would have them do unto you" and to be as diligent, kind and caring as I can possibly be. I make every effort to keep up with the requirements and changes in my industry and learn something every day. I always give my word that I will be honorable, hard-working and effective in my communication with clients and peers.

I have done reverse loans for over 20 years and now specialize in them. So many of our senior population, who own homes, are in need of debt relief or additional income and the reverse loan is an amazing tool for these very special people. I truly enjoy my work with those who are the foundation of our American way of life. I look forward to working with you.

           My name is Kelly Conour. I grew up in Ventura County, CA and have lived in the CA Central Valley since 1985. I am married and have raised 5 amazing boys. My dream job was to be a Nurse – that never happened – but with the boys, there was always opportunity to try my hand at that profession.

I began my career in the financial world in 1985 as a bank teller for Guarantee Savings. My desire then, as it is still, is to learn everything I could to be the very best at my job. I quickly moved into new positions as my knowledge increased and eventually found the lending side of finance to be fascinating. I left the bank and began processing mortgage loans in 1993 and, with the exception of a short hiatus, I have been in this business since then.

During my years in the mortgage business I have been a processor; an office manager; an underwriter; and at times, all three simultaneously. I thoroughly love my job – especially now. Since the beginning of 2017, I am a licensed mortgage loan originator. This has been the most rewarding position of all. I am fortunate to be able to use my years of training to help senior citizens retain their independence, have peace of mind in their finances and live a more rewarding life.
